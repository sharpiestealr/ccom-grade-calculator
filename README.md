# ccom-grade-calculator
listen, i just wanted to write something to calculate grades for me.

i know, i should have used sql. i refuse to do that. i hate sql. i would prefer to use excel than to use sql.

anyway if you want to just download a copy to play with, download notas.exe and have fun.

i'm currently taking 0 constructive criticism on this, thanks.
